                        I obtained my BSc in Statistics and Operations Research from Hong Kong Baptist University in
                        2019. Now I am studying for a MSc in Electronic and Information Engineering in the Hong Kong
                        Polytechnic University.

                        Meanwhile, during my university, I participated in some extra-curricular activities. In January
                        2017, I went to Maldives, to join in an International Volunteer Program. During the Program, I
                        took part in some environmental projects and community work. In June, 2017, I went to Vancouver,
                        Canada, to take part in the UBC summer program. In July 2018, I went to Beijing, to take part in
                        a Summer Program of Data Science in Beijing Normal University.

                        My hobby is playing basketball. During my university, I joined the Basketball team of mainland
                        students. And I was being the captain during my Year 2 of university.
